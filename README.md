bashTheObjects

This is a quirky object oriented library for bash.  It supports some basic
reflection and utility functions and has a built-in debugger.  There are
a few classes for generating CGI scripts.

The project is being abandoned, but I'll accept changes and fixes if you
want to contribute.

Artistic license.  Do what you want with it.
