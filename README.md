bashTheObjects

This is a simple to use object oriented library for bash.  It supports some
basic reflection and utility functions.  The class library is small at the
moment, but it will be built up soon, mostly with CGI/Web related functions.
There will also be some system-admin and install scripts done in this for
a web-based linux-installer.

Artistic license.  Do what you want with it.
