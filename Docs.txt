bashTheObjects
==============

	This project is designed to bring OOP to standard bash in way that is
simple.  It came about because I wanted to develop a custom linux-installer
for another project and text-based installers are dead, writing my own GUI
would take way too long, and RedHat's installer is way too complicated and
does some things I don't like.  So, I decided on a web-based installer.  This
has some nice side-effects, such as being able to install to headless systems.
The next question, was what to write it in.
	There are plenty of languages around, and thats the problem.  I didn't
want people to have to learn some new language to be able to expand and modify
the installer.  The obvious solution was plain bash, but maintaining a bash
script over time is incredibly painful.  What if bash had OOP?
	Enter bashTheObjects!

Calling Methods
===============

First, your main code should source the library file, oop.lib.sh
Then you can import classes with "import".  This isn't actually
required as "new" will import classes automatically, but if you want
access to other static methods before calling new, or need to run
other code in your class file at a certain time, import will do it.
	import <classname>

Construction:
	new <classname> <varname> [<args>]

	Ex: new HtmlPage main title:"Cgi Test"

This creates the variable you pass it as an instance and calls the class
constructor.  The constructor can get the name of the variable as $varname.

Instance Methods:
	varname.method [<args>]

	Ex: main.add style:globalStyle content:mainDiv

	Like in typical bash, the return value will be numeric.  To return some
other variable, print it and call the method like this:
	$(varname.method [<args>])

Arguments:
	Arguments are prefixed with an argument name followed by a colon.  You
name your arguments when you pass them.  This means that arguments can be in
nearly any order.  Your arguments will be placed in local variables of the
same name as the argument.  Spaces are allowed, but in this case you should
quote the argument, although its not actually necessary!
	You can have the first argument be unnamed if you wish.  The variable will
be named "value" when it is passed to the method.  You can also pass arrays of
values by using an argument called "all".  Another variable called "vars" is a
a list of all argument variables that have been passed, which you can loop
through.  This lets your code manage multiple styles of invocations based on 
the arguments it sees.
	For example:
		main.add all:div1 div2 div3

	and I could also do
		main.add div4
	or the example above.



Creating Classes
================

CLASS DEFINITION

A class begins with the "class" keyword followed by the class name.

You should then list the variables and public functions of the class.
	public <funcname> 		makes a public method
	inst var <varname> 		an attribute of an instance
	static var <varname>	a class variable, shared by all instances
	const var <varname>		the same as static, but changes aren't saved

	You can also specify a default value after any variable and this value is
used to initialize the variable.  The word "var" means a generic bash-style
variable.  You can place one of your own classnames here or "Array" or "Hash"
to use more complex variables (this feature is still not working).


METHOD DEFINITIONS

	You now list all your private and public methods.  This is done just as a
normal bash function with a name of class::function.  Inside each function,
your arguments, SELF, and CLASS are defined for you.  You call private methods
directly as class::function.  Beware that this should only be done from inside
another method that you could call with the dot operation described above.  If
you absolutely need to call a method from outside the class (static methods),
then use the "callMethod" function.  You pass it the SELF variable, then the
classname, then function name, then any arguments.  For example:
		
		callMethod '' MyClass MyFunction var1:value var2:value2
		
		... and MyClass::MyFunction will get called, and variables are set
		and restored.  Obviously, if you use instance variables, you'll need
		a valid SELF instead of the placeholder shown.

	The constructor has the format classname::classname


GETTERS/SETTERS

	You can do this really easy with really short functions.  In fact, you can
make your variables public, like this ...
	
		Class::set() { :; }
		Class::get() { println ${!value}; }

	Make sure those functions are "public" and then you can call them with
		varname.set attr1:"value" attr2:"value2" attr3:"My value"
	And if the parameter has the same name as an attribute (var) it will be set
	Likewise,
		$(varname.get attr1)
	will return the value of attr1.



Utility Functions
=================

print 		a safer version of echo.  This version has no terminating newline
println 	as above, with a newline
debug x 	debug takes the debug level to associate the message with and the
			message string.  You can set the DEBUG variable to determine how
			verbose the output is, or set DEBUG to a filename for everything!
assert 		Simple asserts.  Kills the program if the given value isn't true
typeof 		returns an object's class
kindof 		tests if a class is in the inheritance tree
implements 	tests if a particular method is implemented
new 		constructor - see above
destroy 	destroy varname will clean up a variable and call your "ondestroy"
set_instance
			use this (no arguments) in your constructor to create a simple
			singleton.  You'll need a class static called "instance".
return_instance
			you call this from a qualified function (class::function) to which
			you pass the name of a variable to set (like with new).  The new
			variable will be set from the static "instance" with all the 
			blessings of a full-fledged object.  See HtmlPage for an example.
import 		imports a class.  The path for classes can be set with CLASSPATH
subclass 	put this and the name of the class you want to inherit from to
			subclass.  This is done with the Style and Icon classes as 
			subclasses of Link.
